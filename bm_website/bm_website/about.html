    <p class="about-text">Welcome! We, Eva Haishun and Dasha Ovsiannikova, are the creators of this platform of expression. We are international undergraduate students with global views and open minds, even though each one of us pursues different professional careers in almost opposite sides of the world. 

    </p>
    <p class="about-text">However, something we do have in common is our passion for self-expression and untamed curiosity. We employ a wide variety of ways in which we express our opinions on different topics and open discussions on some controversial issues. 
    </p>
    <p class="about-texts">In our podcasts you can find interviews we conduct with guest-speakers related to a certain topic. They present to us the insight information on issues we choose to explore. In order to share our own opinions and experiences related to the topic, we film a complimentary video. In this way, we leave no theme unexplored, shedding light on every possible side of each one of them.
    </p>
    <p class="about-texts">Last, but certainly not the least is our writing. It may well be considered more personal than other types of content, and this time the main themes are rather philosophical than controversial. The weekly posts offer a glimpse into our everyday thoughts, which we take onto the next level and develop them into something complete. 
    </p>
    <p class="about-texts">Whichever your preferences may be, we hope you find our content enjoyable! Stay tuned!</p>
