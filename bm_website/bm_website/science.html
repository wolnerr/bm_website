        <p>Knowingly or subconsciously, all of us conduct experiments on ourselves. When you feel a headache, you try to go back a few steps and see what might have caused it. “Maybe I shouldn’t have spent so much time on my computer…”, “I overslept today, maybe that’s why…”, “There’s just been too much stress at work lately, I need to take it easier…”</p>
            <p>And so we try changing these potential factors one by one, to see if eliminating or modifying any one of them would make a difference. But for some of us (I don’t have the authority to state the exact percentage) feel the need or desire to take experimentation on ourselves further. One thing I hate is generalizations, so in order to avoid it I am going to speak about my own experiments on myself, and see where that takes me. </p>
           
            <p>I find human mind to be the most fascinating and understudied mystery. The scope? Well, I guess it’s the Universe. When I read about the SpaceX Starship being launched into the interplanetary spaces, I wonder how different the literal and figurative worldview of the astronaut is. When I watch the news coverage of peaceful protesters being attacked by a dictator-backed militia, I ask myself what could have happened in the life of this man, which would drive him to give out deadly orders.</p>
            <p>I get goosebumps when I learn about experimentation on human mind. How do I bring out the unconscious into the conscious? Can I hallucinate without drugs? What amount of the latent thoughts and desires am I ready to accept into my life? </p>
            <p>I find the gate into Wonderland to be my dreams. Not daydreams of course, since what I want is to release any control and get a glimpse of what’s buried in the pulsating convolutions of my brain. You get that when all physical stimuli are deactivated, and your mind takes over. Here I won’t go into any scientific details surrounding the subject, and my story won’t be the one of magical revelations and the sudden opening of the third eye. I simply let myself feel and experience whatever my mind decides to serve, and here is how it goes.</p>
            <p>My first semi-intentional attempt to tame my unconscious mind happened when I was about ten years old. I remember laying on my back, about to go to sleep. I closed my eyes, and a strange new thought came to me: what if I try to catch the exact moment when I fall asleep? I lay there still, breathing quietly, not to scare away the Sandman… I stare into the darkness of my eyelids, when suddenly I start noticing dark shapeless figures moving slowly somewhere far from me. As I continued to make out what’s out there, the figures started taking on more familiar shapes. They ripened like fruits or berries before me, and their movement was becoming more lively and coordinated. I saw the characters from my favorite movies and cartoons, I also saw creatures barely resembling anything I saw or knew existed before. They sway and I fall asleep.</p>
            <p>My next noteworthy attempt to study the dream state of my mind took place a year ago. The preceding few months had been very stressful for me; I wasn’t feeling in control over myself and got into a few situations that shook my mental balance. I felt a desperate need to look for the answers in myself. And so I turned for help to dreams. At that time I got infatuated by Freud’s Interpretation of Dreams, which inspired me to document every single one of my dreams, and subsequently subject them to a pedantic analysis. Recently I went over my notes from that time, and I reread some of the analyses. I’m not going to lie – now I find many of them quite disturbing. </p>
            <p>I was very dedicated to my new hobby. I found certain repeating patterns of behavior, characters and colors prevailing in my dreams, and I believed that I was discovering my hidden self in them. </p>
           <p>Like I said – there was no grand revelation. The second and last attempt ended for a simple reason – it was becoming more and more painful for me to do it. Maybe I would want to forget some of those visions and never come across them again. But then the experiment wouldn’t satisfy my need to be honest with myself… The ideas and feelings were indeed repeating themselves, and I found myself lost in the maze of my own mind. There was no universal answer I was determined to find. </p>
            <p>As I passed my long-drawn writer’s block, writing songs became a therapy dreams once were for me. If you think about it, there is a certain parallel between the two: you turn your mind inside-out and scoop out everything there is before it dissolves back into the darkness of the unconscious. There is surely more control in poetry and music, even though I tend to fall into a kind of entrancement when I write or compose. However these limitations are what makes art therapeutic: you never get torn down or swept off of your feet by an incontrollable and destructive wave of phantoms in your mind. Who knows, maybe they are better off out there, on the other side of the door to Wonderland…</p>
