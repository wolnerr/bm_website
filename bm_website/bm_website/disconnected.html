        <p>During the weekend my friend and I could not decide which movie to watch. Most of the time, this argument remains unresolved, and we figure that it would be best to do something else instead. But not this time. After half hour, we eventually settled on the 1981 Italian Rom-Com “Madly in Love.” Even though both of us did not enjoy the movie, one scene became an inspiration to this very post. </p>
            <p>The protagonist of the movie, Barnaba Cecchini, played by Adriano Celentano, is a public bus driver. He is punctual when it comes to schedules and attentive when it comes to the passengers. His co-workers enjoy his company, and passengers appreciate the times when he is behind the wheel. This daily interaction between bus passengers and the bus driver brought my attention. </p>
           <p>For the rest of the movie, I had a question stuck in the head, “In what universe do you know your bus driver so well?” I asked my friend, but she only shrugged, suggesting that I was missing the main point of the movie, but I could not help it. </p>
            <p>There are 40 years and 2.336 km in between a Rome bus driver Barnaba, and a Minsk bus passenger me; however, I feel more connected with him than with any bus driver I encounter on a daily basis.</p>
           <p> Back when I was at school, I used to go to the same bus station, at the same time, and drive the same bus. I was doing the same ritual every day for about three years, and not once did I think about the bus driver. If I were to ask whether the bus 14 had a new driver every day or it was all the same person, I would not be able to answer. I never paid attention. </p>
           <p> Our lives are full of people: they drive us to work, help us around the house, work with us, they walk the same streets and eat the same foods, yet we have no idea who they are. We do not pay attention to them, and maybe we should. </p>
            <p>Modern technology helps us to connect with people across the Atlantic, but it probably also prevent us from socializing with people living next door. We make daily choices: respond to the messages and phone calls or ignore them, work from home, or travel to the office, order groceries, or go to the physical stores. Unlike in the 1980s, we can form long-distant meaningful connections and simultaneously avoid interactions with people from our surroundings. Yet the question is, "Do the relationships we do not have with our neighbors harm us?"</p>
           <p> In industrialized countries, 1/3 of the population suffer from loneliness. People living in the vibrant, buzzing cities feel disconnected from each other: amongst millions of others, they feel distant. They feel disconnected from the rest of the population. </p> 
           <p>I felt lonely quite a few times, but I always linked it to my introversion, yet as it turns out, I was just amongst many people, stigmatizing the concept. During my research, I have found a few interesting details.</p>
            <p>Loneliness is usually tied in with social isolation and related to poor social skills. People assume that socially isolated individuals are the ones suffering from loneliness. In those cases, the public advises to seek for more human connections as a way to feel less lonely, but it does not help the majority of people struggling with it, and the reason for that lies in the definitions. Loneliness is a subjective feeling that the existing connections (or their absence) are unfulfilling, whereas social isolation is a state where social connections are limited. In other words, it demonstrates that social isolation can co-exist with loneliness, but it does not necessarily cause it.</p>
            <p>During the pandemic, people all over the world were trapped in their houses. Some of them have enjoyed having limited connections: they did not experience drawbacks from it. This example proves that loneliness ties with our feelings and perceptions of the surroundings. In this sense, the number of people that surround us daily does not matter, as long as they make us fulfilled. So, it does not matter whether we will know each of our neighbors by name or have no conversations for weeks. It is purely subjective and requires a dipper understanding of personal preferences. </p>
            <p>I do not know, whether now it is possible to live in the world, where every bus passenger knows the name of the bus driver and has a meaningful conversation with him every day, but if it something that will bring you a sense of fulfillment in life, it will not hurt to try… but wait for proper timing, safety first. </p>
